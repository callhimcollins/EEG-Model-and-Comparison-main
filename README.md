# EEG Classification with ANN and Model Comparison

## Overview
This project develops an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for EEG classification and compares its performance against **Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models using key metrics and visualizations.

## Features
- **EEG Data Preprocessing**: Standardization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.
- **ANN Model**: Optimized neural network architecture for EEG classification.
- **Machine Learning Comparisons**: Performance evaluation against Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Visualization**: Performance comparison using plots.
